This section provides step-by-step guides to help you effectively use FluxFakr.

## Running a Stock Market Data Simulation

1. **Build the Project:**

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. **Run the Simulator:**

   ```bash
   ./target/release/fluxfakr --module stock --mps 100 --variants 5\
    --broker localhost:9092 --topic market-data
   ```

   This simulates market data at 100 messages per second for 5 instruments.

   Sample messages

   ```json
   {"ask":194.87817534561705,"bid":194.2493874690181,"instrument":"STK0","price":194.56378140731758,"timestamp":1738677164,"volume":1283}
   {"ask":194.901509312583,"bid":194.48144141492307,"instrument":"STK0","price":194.69147536375303,"timestamp":1738677165,"volume":2386}
   {"ask":195.09920944595802,"bid":194.36777989565638,"instrument":"STK0","price":194.7334946708072,"timestamp":1738677166,"volume":3545}
   ```

   Sample of output when app is terminated

   ```csv
    id,price,bid,ask,volume
    STK0,194.73,194.37,195.10,3545
   ```


## Running a Supermarket Sales Data Simulation

1. **Build the Project:**

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. **Run the Simulator:**

   ```bash
   ./target/release/fluxfakr --module supermarket --mps 100 --variants 1\
    --broker localhost:9092 --topic supermarket
   ```

   This simulates market data at 100 messages per second - note that variants is ignored as the orders are based on a defined range of products.

   Sample messages

   ```json
    {"transaction_id":"TXN-43263346","basket_id":"BASKET-2787","timestamp":1738712746,"store":{"town":"Hagenes haven","state":"ND","country":"USA"},"customer":{"age":27,"income_band":"Low"},"product":{"product_name":"Kids T-Shirt","category":"Clothing","subcategory":"Children","unit_price":8.49},"quantity":2,"total_price":16.98}
    {"transaction_id":"TXN-43263346","basket_id":"BASKET-2787","timestamp":1738712746,"store":{"town":"Hagenes haven","state":"ND","country":"USA"},"customer":{"age":27,"income_band":"Low"},"product":{"product_name":"Nail Clippers","category":"Pets","subcategory":"Grooming","unit_price":7.49},"quantity":1,"total_price":7.49}
    {"transaction_id":"TXN-43263346","basket_id":"BASKET-2787","timestamp":1738712746,"store":{"town":"Hagenes haven","state":"ND","country":"USA"},"customer":{"age":27,"income_band":"Low"},"product":{"product_name":"Sunscreen","category":"Beauty","subcategory":"Skincare","unit_price":28.99},"quantity":4,"total_price":115.96}
    {"transaction_id":"TXN-43263346","basket_id":"BASKET-2787","timestamp":1738712746,"store":{"town":"Hagenes haven","state":"ND","country":"USA"},"customer":{"age":27,"income_band":"Low"},"product":{"product_name":"Shampoo","category":"Beauty","subcategory":"Haircare","unit_price":23.49},"quantity":1,"total_price":23.49}
   ```

   Sample of output when app is terminated

   ```text
    Basket Summary: transaction_id: TXN-44989526, basket_id: BASKET-7644, items_generated: 12, total_items: 12
   ```


## Customization

You can adjust simulation parameters such as drift and volatility in the code, at some point we'd like to add module-specific parameters to the command line.
